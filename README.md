# Butters-Webpage
Mobile Webpage design (for now) of butters as a Template

Created a Mobile Webpage design template with butters as the placeholder

The Header is a teal bar with a navigation.  On this design i played with the font families a bit more along with text shadows.  
The following section is the person section which highlights who the page is about followed by one of their most frequent quotes. 

Proceeding down is the showcase showing off the persons projects and recent work they have done and finally the last section letting the reader know where and when they can be able to see the persons performances
